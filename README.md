## Story

You are a lonely person peacefully living in the desert, far from the noise of the city. And some Mafia starts disturbing your peace of mind with their bike.

What they are not aware of is that you are a bigger Mafia than them. So you take out your exploding bullet gun and start shooting them one by one. And to keep your self-respect, you wouldn't allow more than 5 of them to leave alive.

But stay alert, their bikes are also equipped with exploding bullet guns. They can shoot you anytime, so you have to keep avoiding their bullets too.
